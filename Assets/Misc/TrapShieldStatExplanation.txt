#Trap Shields - collision triggered, buffs self, located at base, absorbs 100% dmg once, destroyed when hit. #


X Cooldown - Reduces the CD of this tower by X when it gets hit


X Drain - when hit, it heals you for X and damages the enemy by X (since this shield type blocks 100% of the enemy damage)


X Zone Range - This causes the shield to be applied to this zone and can be upgraded to cause it to cover other zones as well. HOWEVER, it is still a 1 hit and dead shield. base = this zone. +1 = random left/right zone, +2 = both left/right zone, +3 keeps up that pattern. max is hits all zones
.  Remember, any existing shield has priority over one you're trying to place.

Field time - when triggered, it will leave a field in the closest section of the zone that procs "drain" effects on all enemies in it every X seconds, as well as reducing CD by X for each enemy in it every X seconds
also. the interaction of CD with Field is:

[6:39] 
when enemies are in the continuous field, towers in those zones get their active cd reduced by X per tick per enemy
