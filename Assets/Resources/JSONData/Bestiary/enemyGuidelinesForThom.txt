the enemy index is a living document

[1231] 
it updates as you learn new things about enemies

[1231] 
the first time you SEE an enemy on screen, it's index is added to the poke-dex

[1231] 
just the image

[1232] 
the first time it hits you, you get it's Damage stat revealed

[1232] 
the first time you kill it, you get it's HP stat revealed

[1236] 
killing an enemy for the first time reveals his Shield amount stat too. (base shield stat)

[1233] 
after 10 kills of that enemy, you know it well and get the description of what it does if it has an ability.

[1233] 
after 50 you get it added to your ability to build enemy waves for other players.

[1233] 
wait. that should be 100

[1233] 
50 should be an emblem for your towers

[1234] 
so if you build a tower specifically to fight that enemy you can just slap that icon on there so you can match tower to enemy easily

[1234] 
and then we'll have other special abilitiesrewards taht are unlocked by killing X of each in a group of enemy types or something.
